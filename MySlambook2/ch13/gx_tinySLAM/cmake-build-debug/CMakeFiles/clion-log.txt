CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/189/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (CSPARSE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (CSparse).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_modules/FindCSparse.cmake:26 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:40 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
